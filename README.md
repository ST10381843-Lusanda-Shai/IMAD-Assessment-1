# IMAD-Assessment-1

My GitHub repository: "https://github.com/ST10381843-Lusanda-Shai/IMAD-Assessment-1.git"

Good evening sir, My meal suggestion app is about showcasing and helping people who would like to be recommended or would like to try a few meals during the course of their daily lives. With this application they will be able to enter the time of day they are currently in and when they enter the inputed time of day my application will display a few meals that will be suggested to them. The user interface is easy to understand and use. When the user enters the wrong input, the app will display a text message which tells them to enter the correct time of day they are currenlty in bewtween: Morning, Mid-morning, Afternoon, Mid-Afternoon, Evening or Midnight. I added 2 images that would related to the topic of meal suggestions that would help enrich the vsiual of the application and give it its own personality. Github is the version control and collaboration of Git and github actions is where coders an programmers can check for errors in their code and automate their development workflows such as building, testing and deplying their code.
